## creating a pdf with LaTeX
To create a pdf it uses LaTeX which makes it all flexible.
But still there are a few things...

## missing

- [ ] a subtitle for more information
- [ ] more math than mat and vec
	- [ ] formula
- [ ] Graphs without images
- [ ] a solo column output file
- [ ] a QR for a reimplement
	- [ ] contains random seed for correction
	- [ ] analyzable

- [ ] overwork struct .tex for the rest

# Try it:
1. clone it (`git clone https://github.com/mow09/document_maker.git`)
2. make env (`virtualenv doc_maker`) in my_path
	- (!) `source my_path/doc_maker/bin/activate`
3. install requirements `pip install -r requirements` in env
4. run `python document.py` to see an example
